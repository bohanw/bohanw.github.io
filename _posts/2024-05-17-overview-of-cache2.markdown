## Transactional KV store
This problem is from a [leetcode discussion post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/279913/bloomberg-onsite-key-value-store-with-transactions)

## Expiry Priority Cache

## Reflection
- Understand the problem and asking any clarifying questions are crucial in success. Unlike many other algorithms-heavy coding problems, above design problems need more communications about thought process to address the cache features and describe what data structures and how chosen data structures address these requirements.
- Try and clarify any confusions during the interview. For interactive and open-ended problems, one may waste time working on a solution trivial or completely incorrect from the requirements from the interviewer. 
- Practice "communicating over pseudocode/typing". I believe success of solving above problems rely more on effectiveness of thought process. I was not comfortable typing and talking together in a virtual interview at first, and I realized how much time I have spent not producing effective code in a short time. Thought process is important but in the end interviewers need to see some code as deliverables. My personal way is to jot down key algorithms/data structures and reasoning behind it, and highlevel todos on implementation. For instance, I will jot down I need hashmap and doubly linked list, and why it will 
- Be very comfortable on common data structures in your interviewing programming language and common APIs and their time complexity. If possible, getting familiar with implementation of each data structure. For example, difference and time complexity of Java `HashMap` and `TreeMap`, C++ `std::unordered_map` and `std::map`.
- Since 2023/2024, I have observed increaseing difficulties in coding challenges. The challenge is not necesarily on difficult algorithms or tricky math theorems or bit manupulations, but more on a combinations of code completion, code speed, time to reach a well-organized solution and effective communications to interviewer. Many problems are framed as follow ups to easier first problem or multiple series. I experienced many design-like problems in both screen and onsite, so practicing all above is worthwhile. Different companies may have different interview expecations or emphasis, and it is perfectly fine to ask and clarify any requirements in advance(how many problems each round, focusing on thought process or completion, etc).
